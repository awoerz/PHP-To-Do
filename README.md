# Adam PHP To Do

## Purpose and Scope: 

As with any good learning project, I am starting with a simple to-do list. I have wanted to learn my way around the humble PHP language for a while and I have to admit that it is quite refreshing to move so quickly without builds, transpiling, or other complicated tooling required for the modern web using Angular, React, Vue and all the other stuff. This app is NOT meant to grow very big. It is meant as a learning exercise to learn some PHP basics as I prepare myself to jump in Laravel in the future.
